# RibEye-T-Board

## Description

This website helped me tackle the webpage design through third party API's. Working in this project made it possible to solve the user's problem to input their tasks through a task organizer. By using a modal to input the user's task data, we are able to access the local storage to create tasks bound to due dates. Making the user aware of their upcoming tasks.
Working with third party's API makes the coding experience more efficient and less chaotic in the design department.
